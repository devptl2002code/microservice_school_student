# Spring Boot Microservices Architecture

This project is a basic microservice architecture built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud Gateway**, and **Netflix Eureka**. It demonstrates how to register services, route requests through an API Gateway, and structure a scalable backend.

## ðŸ§± Project Modules

### 1. `eureka-server`
- Acts as the **service registry** using **Netflix Eureka**.
- All other services register themselves here.

### 2. `cloud-gateway`
- Acts as the **API Gateway**.
- Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway** to route external traffic to appropriate services.
- Applies filters and forwards requests to microservices.

### 3. `student-service`
- Microservice that handles student-related operations.
- Registered with Eureka and accessible via API Gateway (`/student` route).

### 4. `school-service`
- Microservice that handles school-related operations.
- Registered with Eureka and accessible via API Gateway (`/school` route).
