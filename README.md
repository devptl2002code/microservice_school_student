# Spring Boot Microservices Architecture

This project is a basic microservice architecture built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud Gateway**, and **Netflix Eureka**. It demonstrates how to register services, route requests through an API Gateway, and structure a scalable backend.

## ðŸ§± Project Modules

### 1. `eureka-server`
- Acts as the **service registry** using **Netflix Eureka**.
- All other services register themselves here.

### 2. `cloud-gateway`
- Acts as the **API Gateway**.
- Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway** to route external traffic to appropriate services.
- Applies filters and forwards requests to microservices.

### 3. `student-service`
- Microservice that handles student-related operations.
- Registered with Eureka and accessible via API Gateway (`/student` route).

### 4. `school-service`
- Microservice that handles school-related operations.
- Registered with Eureka and accessible via API Gateway (`/school` route).
- Uses **MySQL** as database.
- Data Access handled via **Spring Data JPA**.
- Includes:
  - DTO-based controller-service mapping
  - Centralized error handling
  - Custom structured API responses
  - Logging via SLF4J + Logback (file + console)
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  - API versioning (`/api/v1/school`)
  - Full CRUD APIs

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.x
- Spring Cloud 2024.0.1
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Netflix Eureka (Service Discovery)
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Lombok
- SLF4J & Logback (logging)
- Swagger / OpenAPI (API documentation)
- Maven

### âœ… Features Implemented Today:
- âœ… Refactored `SchoolService` to use `DTO` classes (`SchoolRequest`, `SchoolResponse`)
- âœ… Added validation and duplicate check before saving
- âœ… Introduced structured logging with custom pattern in `application.properties`
- âœ… Used `@Slf4j` and meaningful logs in service and controller
- âœ… Proper error handling with `ErrorResponse` DTO
- âœ… Swagger documentation using `@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`
- âœ… Fully versioned API path (`/api/v1/school`)
- âœ… Built POST, GET, DELETE APIs with proper response structure

---

### Prerequisites:
- Java 17
- Maven
- (Optional) Postman or Swagger UI for API testing
